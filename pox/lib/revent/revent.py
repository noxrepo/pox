# decorator for adding event classes to a class?

"""
Revent is an event system wherein objects become a composition of data,
methods, and now events.  It fits with the publish/subscribe communication
pattern.

Events themselves are generally instances of some subclass of the Event
class.  In fact, they can be arbitrary values of any sort, though
subclasses of Event get special handling (and support for values of other
sorts may eventually be removed).

To subscribe to an event, you create a callback function and register it
with the source.  For example:

def bar_handler(self, event):
  print("bar!", event)

pox.core.addListener(UpEvent, bar_handler)


Often (especially if you are going to listen to multiple events from a
single source), it is easier to inherit from EventMixin just so that you
can use the listenTo() method.  For example:

class Sink (EventMixin):
  def __init__(self):
   # Listen to events sourced by pox.core
   pox.core.addListeners(self)
   self.listenTo(pox.core)

  def _handle_ComponentRegistered (self, event):
    # The name of this method has a special meaning to addListeners().
    # If a method name starts with _handle_ and ends with the name of
    # an event that the source publishes, the method is automatically
    # registered as an event handler.
    #
    # This method will now be called whenever pox.core triggers a
    # ComponentRegistered event.

    # Most event handlers are passed an event object as a parameter (though
    # individual Event classes can override this behavior by altering their
    # _invoke() method).
    component = event.component
    name = event.name
    print("I see you,", name, "!")


Event sources can also use the EventMixin library:

class Source (EventMixin):
  # Defining this variable tells the revent library what kind of events
  # this source can raise.
  _eventMixin_events = set([ComponentRegistered])

  def __init__ (self):
    foo()

  def foo (self):
    # We can raise events as follows:
    component = "fake_pox_component"
    self.raiseEvent(ComponentRegistered(component))

    # In the above invocation, the argument is an instance of
    # ComponentRegistered (which is a subclass of Event).  The following is
    # functionally equivalent, but has the nice property that
    # ComponentRegistered is never instantiated if there are no listeners.
    #self.raiseEvent(ComponentRegistered, component)
    # In both cases, "component" is passed to the __init__ method for the
    # ComponentRegistered class.

    # The above method invocation will raise an exception if an event
    # handler rauses an exception.  To project yourself from exceptions in
    # handlers, see raiseEventNoErrors().
