"""
The POX Messenger system.


The Messenger system is a way to build services in POX that can be
consumed by external clients.

Sometimes a controller might need to interact with the outside world.
Sometimes you need to integrate with an existing piece of software and
maybe you don't get to choose how you communicate with it.  Other times,
you have the opportunity and burden of rolling your own.  The Messenger
system is meant to help you with the latter case.

In short, channels are a system for communicating between POX and
external programs by exchanging messages encoded in JSON.  It is intended
to be quite general, both in the communication models it supports and in
the transports is supports (as of this writing, it supports a
straightforward TCP socket transport and an HTTP transport).  Any
service written to use the Messenger should theoretically be usable via
any transport.

*Connections* are somehow established when a client connects via some
*Transport*.  The server can individually send messages to a specific client.
A client can send messages to a *Channel* on the server.  A client can also
become a member of a channel, after which it will receive any messages
the server sends to that channel.  There is always a default channel with
no name.

Channels can either be permanent or temporary.  Temporary channels are
automatically destroyed when they no longer contain any members.
