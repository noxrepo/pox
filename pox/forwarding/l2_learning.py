class LearningSwitch (EventMixin):
  """
  The learning switch "brain" associated with a single OpenFlow switch.

  When we see a packet, we'd like to output it on a port which will
  eventually lead to the destination.  To accomplish this, we build a
  table that maps addresses to ports.

  We populate the table by observing traffic.  When we see a packet
  from some source coming from some port, we know that source is out
  that port.

  When we want to forward traffic, we look up the desintation in our
  table.  If we don't know the port, we simply send the message out
  all ports except the one it came in on.  (In the presence of loops,
  this is bad!).

  In short, our algorithm looks like this:

  For each new flow:
  1) Use source address and port to update address/port table
  2) Does destination address fall into Bridge Filtered MAC Group Address
     range and pass_bf_frames parameter is unset?
     Yes:
        2a) Drop packet to avoid forwarding link-local traffic (LLDP, 802.1x)
            DONE
  3) Is destination multicast?
     Yes:
        3a) Flood the packet
            DONE
  4) Port for destination address in our address/port table?
     No:
        4a) Flood the packet
            DONE
  5) Is output port the same as input port?
     Yes:
        5a) Drop packet and similar ones for a while
  6) Install flow table entry in the switch so that this
     flow goes out the appopriate port
     6a) Send buffered packet out appopriate port
