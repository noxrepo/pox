This is the main OpenFlow module.

Along with libopenflow, this is the major part of the OpenFlow API in POX.
There are a number of Events, which are generally raised on core.openflow
as well as on individual switch Connections.  Many of these events have at
least some of the following properties:
 .connection - a reference to the switch connection that caused the event
 .dpid - the DPID of the switch that caused the event
 .ofp - the OpenFlow message that caused the event (from libopenflow)

One of the more complicated aspects of OpenFlow is dealing with stats
replies, which may come in multiple parts (it shouldn't be that that
difficult, really, but that hasn't stopped it from beind handled wrong
wrong more than once).  In POX, the raw events are available, but you will
generally just want to listen to the aggregate stats events which take
care of this for you and are only fired when all data is available.

NOTE: This module is usually automatically loaded by pox.py
