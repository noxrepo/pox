The Topology module is the root of an object model composed of entities
like switches, hosts, links, etc.  This object model is populated by other
modules.  For example, openflow.topology populates the topology object
with OpenFlow switches.

Note that this means that you often want to invoke something like:
   $ ./pox.py topology openflow.discovery openflow.topology
