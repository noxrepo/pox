Keep track of hosts in the network, where they are and how they are
configured (at least MAC/IP addresses)

For the time being, it keeps tables with the information; later, it should
transfer that information to Topology and handle just the actual
discovery/update of host information.

Timer configuration can be changed when needed (e.g., for debugging) using
the launch facility (check timeoutSec dict and PingCtrl.pingLim).
