The GUI is currently under development. It features a log view where debugging 
messages are displayed, an interactive topology view, and a console for manually
sending json-formatted messages to NOX.


To run, you need to install the Qt bindings for python:
    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 
    
    (python-qt4-sql
    libqt4-sql-sqlite  ?)
    

For Debian Lenny Distributions, aka for anyone developing withing the mininet VM
you will need to upgrade to python-qt 4.7.3 which is not in the default repos.
Instructions (thanks Rean!):
in file /etc/apt/sources.list comment out default repos and add:
    deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
    deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
then run
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-qt4
revert to the old sources.list
